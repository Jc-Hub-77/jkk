# Production Readiness Checklist & Recommendations

This document provides a checklist of crucial considerations and recommendations for deploying and maintaining this trading platform in a production environment. Many of these points expand on the configurations already present in `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `DEPLOYMENT.MD`.

## I. Application Configuration & Deployment
- [ ] **Verify `docker-compose.prod.yml`:** Ensure you are using `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production deployments, as it includes production-specific settings (Gunicorn, no code mounts, etc.).
- [ ] **Environment Variables:** Confirm all required environment variables (see `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `backend/.env.example`) are securely provided to the containers by your deployment platform. This includes:
    - `ENVIRONMENT=production`
    - `DATABASE_URL` (pointing to production DB)
    - `REDIS_URL` (pointing to production Redis)
    - `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (unique, strong key)
    - `API_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (unique, strong key for encrypting sensitive data)
    - `GUNICORN_WORKERS` (e.g., 2 * number_of_cores + 1)
    - `CELERY_CONCURRENCY` (appropriate for your workload, e.g., 8-16 for I/O bound tasks)
    - `CELERY_WORKER_REPLICAS` (in `docker-compose.prod.yml` `deploy` section, e.g., 2-4 or more based on load)
    - SMTP settings for email notifications.
    - Payment gateway keys.
    - `STRATEGIES_DIR` pointing to the correct location.
    - `FRONTEND_URL` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for CORS.
- [ ] **Frontend API URL:** Ensure `frontend/js/config.js` has `window.BACKEND_API_BASE_URL = "";` if serving frontend and backend API via a reverse proxy on the same domain.
- [ ] **Nginx/Reverse Proxy:** Implement Nginx (or similar) as a reverse proxy to:
    - Serve the static frontend files.
    - Proxy API requests to the backend (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8000` as configured in `docker-compose.prod.yml`).
    - Implement SSL/TLS for HTTPS (e.g., using Let's Encrypt).
    - Optionally, add security headers, caching rules.

## II. Automated Testing
- [ ] **Write Comprehensive Tests:** The project is set up with `pytest` (`backend/tests/`). It is CRITICAL to write comprehensive automated tests:
    - **Unit Tests:** For individual functions, methods, and classes in services, models, and utilities.
    - **Integration Tests:** For interactions between components (e.g., API endpoints and services, services and database). Test API authentication, data validation, and business logic.
    - **Strategy Logic Tests:** Rigorously test each trading strategy's logic, including edge cases and simulated market conditions if possible.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that automatically runs tests on every commit/PR and automates deployments to staging/production.

## III. Security
- [ ] **Secrets Management:** For sensitive data like `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `API_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, database credentials, and payment gateway keys, use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault) as recommended in `backend/SECRETS.MD`. Avoid relying solely on manually configured environment variables if your platform doesn't offer secure injection and at-rest encryption for them.
- [ ] **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and infrastructure.
- [ ] **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan dependencies (`requirements.txt`, frontend libraries) for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `safety`, `npm audit` or GitHub Dependabot).
- [ ] **Input Validation:** Ensure all user inputs (API requests, forms) are strictly validated on the backend.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- [ ] **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF for an additional layer of security.
- [ ] **Permissions & Access Control:** Ensure database users and application roles have the minimum necessary permissions.

## IV. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] **Centralized Logging:** Implement centralized logging for all services (web, worker).
    - *Suggestions:* ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Grafana Loki with Promtail.
- [ ] **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):**
    - *Suggestions:* Prometheus with Grafana for metrics, Sentry for error tracking, or commercial APM tools.
- [ ] **Celery Monitoring:** Set up Celery Flower or a similar tool to monitor Celery tasks, queues, and workers.
    - Add `flower` to `requirements.txt` and include it in your `docker-compose.prod.yml` if desired.
- [ ] **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of your servers/containers.
- [ ] **Alerting:** Configure alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, and security events.

## V. Database Management
- [ ] **Production Database:** Use a robust production-grade PostgreSQL instance (e.g., managed cloud service like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or a self-hosted, well-configured instance).
- [ ] **Performance Tuning:** Monitor and tune database performance (query optimization, indexing).
- [ ] **Regular Backups:** Implement and regularly test a reliable database backup and recovery strategy.
- [ ] **Connection Pooling:** Ensure database connection pooling is appropriately configured for the expected load (FastAPI/SQLAlchemy usually handles this, but settings might need tuning).

## VI. Scalability & Reliability
- [ ] **Load Testing:** Conduct load testing to understand performance bottlenecks and determine appropriate scaling for Gunicorn workers, Celery workers, and database resources.
- [ ] **Horizontal Scaling:** Be prepared to scale web and worker services horizontally (running more containers) based on load.
- [ ] **Database Read Replicas:** For read-heavy workloads, consider using database read replicas.
- [ ] **Data Redundancy & Failover:** Plan for data redundancy and service failover.

This checklist is a starting point. Adapt and expand it based on your specific operational requirements and risk assessment.
