# This is a sample test file to initialize the pytest framework.
# More comprehensive tests for all modules (API endpoints, services,
# utilities, trading logic, models, etc.) should be added here
# and in other test files within this 'tests' directory.

# Future tests could involve:
# - Testing API endpoint responses (e.g., using FastAPI's TestClient)
# - Testing service layer logic with mock dependencies
# - Testing utility functions with various inputs
# - Testing database models and interactions (potentially with a test database)
# - Testing Celery tasks
# - Testing specific trading strategy logic under various market conditions (mocked data)
