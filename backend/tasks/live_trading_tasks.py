    # Accessing the 'runner' instance from here is not straightforward unless passed around or stored globally (not recommended).
    # The primary mechanism for stopping will be the LiveStrategyRunner's internal `is_running` flag,
    # which should be set by its `stop()` method. The SystemExit from SIGTERM should trigger the `finally` block.
    # If direct access to runner is needed, it would require significant refactoring.
    
    # For now, we rely on the main try/except SystemExit and the finally block in the task body.
    # If we had stored the runner instance on `self.request` (e.g. self.request.runner = runner), we could do:
    # if hasattr(self.request, 'runner') and self.request.runner:
    #    self.request.runner.stop()

    # It's also good practice to update the DB status here if possible,
    # but direct DB updates from task signal handlers can be tricky with sessions.
    # It's often better to have the main task logic handle DB updates in its finally block.
    logger.info(f"[Task ID: {task_id}] Revoke handler finished.")

# Note: The _decrypt_data in exchange_service.py needs to use the API_ENCRYPTION_KEY from settings,
# ensure it's correctly initialized there (as it seems to be from previous logs).
# The LiveStrategyRunner itself has a loop with time.sleep. Revoking the task (SIGTERM)
# should interrupt this sleep and lead to SystemExit, triggering the finally block.
# The LiveStrategyRunner's stop() method sets its internal is_running flag.
# The db_session_factory is now dynamically imported in the task.Okay, I have updated `backend/tasks/live_trading_tasks.py` with the necessary changes.

Here's a summary of the key modifications:

*   Dynamically imports the `db_session_factory` using the `db_session_factory_pickleable` string path.
*   Passes the `task_id` to `LiveStrategyRunner` for more informative logging.
*   Includes a basic `try/except SystemExit` block to catch termination signals and attempt to call `runner.stop()`.
*   Includes a `finally` block for final cleanup and logging, also attempting to stop the runner if it's still marked as running.
*   Added an `on_revoke` handler for the task, although its ability to directly stop the runner is limited without further refactoring. The primary stop mechanism relies on `SystemExit` interrupting the runner's loop and the `finally` block in the main task execution.
*   Ensured that the `API_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (if string) is encoded to bytes before being used by `_decrypt_data`, assuming `_decrypt_data` expects bytes or handles the Fernet key internally. The current `_decrypt_data` in `exchange_service.py` uses a globally initialized `cipher_suite` which itself uses `settings.API_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

The API key decryption logic in `run_live_strategy_task` now calls `_decrypt_data` without passing the key explicitly, as `_decrypt_data` (and the `cipher_suite` it uses) should already be initialized with `settings.API_ENCRYPTION_KEY` when the Celery worker starts and imports `exchange_service.py`.

All specified modifications for this subtask should now be complete.
The `LiveTradingService` now dispatches tasks to Celery, and the Celery task `run_live_strategy_task` is set up to manage the lifecycle of a `LiveStrategyRunner`.
API keys are fetched encrypted by the service, passed to the task, and decrypted within the task.
The `LiveStrategyRunner` is defined and used as planned.
The Celery app is configured to discover tasks in `backend.tasks.live_trading_tasks`.
