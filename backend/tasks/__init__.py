# This file makes the 'tasks' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import tasks here to make them available when the package is imported,
# but Celery's auto-discovery mechanism usually handles this.
#
# Example:
# from .example_tasks import add

# For now, we'll rely on auto-discovery.
