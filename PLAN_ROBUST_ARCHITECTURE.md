This diagram illustrates the robust architecture where the Web Server handles API requests, sending background tasks (strategies, backtests) to the Task Queue Broker. Task Queue Workers pick up and execute these tasks independently. All components interact with the Database and Exchanges, with credentials managed securely. Monitoring is in place across the system.

**Plan Steps:**

**Phase 1: Introduce Task Queue & Core Infrastructure**

1.  **Introduce a Task Queue (e.g., Celery):**
    *   Integrate a task queue library into your backend project. Celery is a popular choice in the Python ecosystem.
    *   This involves setting up a message broker (like RabbitMQ or Redis) that the web server and worker processes will use to communicate.
    *   Define your live trading strategy execution and backtesting as "tasks" that can be sent to the task queue.

2.  **Adapt Live Trading Service for Task Queue:**
    *   Modify [`backend/services/live_trading_service.py`](backend\services\live_trading_service.py) so that instead of starting strategies in local threads, it sends a message to the task queue to start a "strategy runner" task for a specific user subscription.
    *   The `LiveStrategyRunner` logic will be adapted to run within a task queue worker process.

3.  **Adapt Backtesting Service for Task Queue:**
    *   Modify [`backend/services/backtesting_service.py`](backend\services\backtesting_service.py) so that when a user requests a backtest, the backend sends a "run backtest" task to the task queue.
    *   The backtesting logic will then be executed by a task queue worker.

4.  **Implement Robust Order and Position Tracking:**
    *   This is crucial when strategies run in separate worker processes. Implement a system (likely involving new database models for `Order` and `Position` in [`backend/models.py`](backend\models.py)) to track the state of live trades initiated by strategies.
    *   Strategies running in workers will record their actions (orders placed, fills received, positions updated) in the database.
    *   The web backend will query this database to show users the status of their live trades and positions.

5.  **Set Up Database Migrations:**
    *   Ensure Alembic is configured (via [`backend/alembic.ini`](backend\alembic.ini) and scripts in [`backend/alembic/`](backend\alembic/)) and create initial migration scripts, including any new tables needed for order/position tracking.

**Phase 2: Complete Backend Services & Strategy Integration**

6.  **Complete Core Backend Services:**
    *   Go through all service files in the [`backend/services/`](backend\services/) directory (`admin_service.py`, `exchange_service.py`, `payment_service.py`, `referral_service.py`, `strategy_service.py`, `user_service.py`).
    *   Implement the full business logic, ensuring services correctly interact with the database and external APIs.
    *   Services that trigger background work (like deploying a strategy or running a backtest) will now interact with the task queue.
    *   Implement comprehensive error handling and logging, ensuring logs from different components (web server, workers) can be collected.

7.  **Refine Strategy Logic for Task Queue Execution:**

    *   Adapt the strategy classes in the [`strategies/`](strategies/) directory (`*.py`) to be suitable for execution within a task queue worker environment. This might involve changes to how they manage state (potentially storing more state in the database) and how they interact with external resources like the exchange (using the provided `exchange_ccxt` instance).
    *   Ensure the `execute_live_signal` method is robust and handles potential interruptions or restarts gracefully (e.g., by checking current position/orders on startup).

8.  **Implement Secure Secrets Management:**

    *   For a distributed production system, using environment variables is a basic step, but a dedicated secrets management solution (like HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secrets managers, or even encrypted secrets files accessed via environment variables) is highly recommended to securely provide database credentials, API keys, encryption keys, etc., to the web server and worker processes.

**Phase 3: Frontend Connectivity & Admin Panel**

9.  **Connect Frontend to Web Backend APIs:**

    *   Update the JavaScript files in [`frontend/js/`](frontend\js/) and [`frontend/admin/js/`](frontend\admin\js/).
    *   Replace conceptual API calls and simulated data with actual `fetch` or equivalent HTTP requests to the completed web backend endpoints under `/api/v1/...`.
    *   Ensure that data received from the backend APIs is correctly parsed and displayed in the corresponding frontend UI elements (including live trading status and history from the new tracking system).

10. **Complete Admin Panel Functionality:**

    *   Ensure all admin-related backend endpoints defined in [`backend/api/v1/admin_router.py`](backend\api\v1\admin_router.py) and their corresponding service functions in [`backend/services/admin_service.py`](backend\services\admin_service.py) are fully implemented.
    *   Connect the admin frontend pages (`frontend/admin/*.html`) to these completed admin backend APIs using JavaScript, enabling full administrative control over users, strategies, payments, etc.

**Phase 4: Deployment & Production Setup**

11. **Define Deployment Architecture:**

    *   The system will consist of multiple components:
        *   Web Server (running FastAPI with Gunicorn or Uvicorn workers)
        *   Task Queue Broker (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ)
        *   Task Queue Workers (running Celery workers to execute strategy and backtest tasks)
        *   Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
    *   These components will typically run as separate processes, potentially on different servers or within containers (Docker).

12. **Containerize Application (Recommended):**

    *   Use Docker to containerize your FastAPI application and your Celery workers. This simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across environments.

13. **Set Up Production Environment:**

    *   Deploy the containerized components to a production environment (e.g., a cloud provider).
    *   Configure process managers (like the ones built into Docker orchestration, Kubernetes, or standalone tools like `supervisord`) to ensure web server and worker processes stay running and restart on failure.

14. **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:**

    *   Set up monitoring for the health and performance of all components (web server, broker, workers, database).
    *   Implement alerting for errors, failed tasks, or critical trading events.

This plan outlines the necessary steps for building a scalable and reliable trading platform capable of handling the load you described. It involves more complexity than the simplified approach but provides the robustness required for production live trading at scale.
